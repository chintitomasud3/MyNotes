What is Hashing?
✅ Definition:
Hashing is a cryptographic process that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, known as the hash value or digest , uniquely represents the input data.

It is a one-way function , meaning that while it is easy to compute a hash from the input data, it is practically impossible to regenerate the original input from the hash.

🔐 Key Features of Hashing:
One-Way Function
You can generate a hash from data, but you cannot reverse the hash to get the original data.
Fixed-Length Output
No matter the size of the input, the output hash is always of the same length.
Example: SHA-256 always produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash.
Deterministic
The same input will always produce the same hash .
Collision Resistant (Ideally)
It should be extremely unlikely that two different inputs produce the same hash .
Fast Computation
A hash function should quickly return the hash value for any given input.
📌 Common Hashing Algorithms:
MD5
128 bits
Not secure anymore (collisions found)
SHA-1
160 bits
Deprecated due to vulnerabilities
SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512)
256 / 512 bits
Secure and widely used
SHA-3
Various
Newer standard, modern use
RIPEMD-160
160 bits
Used in some cryptocurrencies

🧾 Uses of Hashing:
Password Storage
Systems store password hashes instead of plain text passwords
Data Integrity Check
Compare hashes before and after transfer to ensure no changes
Digital Signatures
Hashes are signed instead of full documents for efficiency
File Deduplication
Identify duplicate files by comparing their hashes
Blockchain
Used extensively for securing blocks and transactions

💡 Example:
bash


1
2
Input: "Hello"
SHA-256 Output: 185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969
Even a small change:

bash


1
2
Input: "hello"
SHA-256 Output: 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9826
Let me know if you want this in note format (PDF-ready) or want to continue with encryption vs hashing vs encoding , or move to salting , hash cracking methods , etc. 😊
