Encryption Notes (CEH & CISSP Perspective)

1. What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using cryptographic algorithms and keys. It ensures data confidentiality by making it accessible only to authorized users with the correct decryption key.

2. Key Concepts in Encryption

Plaintext: The original readable data.

Ciphertext: The encrypted (scrambled) version of the data.

Encryption Algorithm: The mathematical function used for encryption and decryption.

Key: A secret value that determines the output of encryption/decryption.

Decryption: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.


3. Types of Encryption

A. Symmetric Encryption (Private Key Encryption)

Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.

Faster but less secure if the key is compromised.

Used in bulk data encryption.

Examples:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Most widely used, secure

DES (Data Encryption Standard) – Outdated, replaced by AES

3DES (Triple DES) – More secure than DES but slower

Blowfish – Lightweight encryption used in VPNs



B. Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Encryption)

Uses a pair of keys: Public Key (for encryption) and Private Key (for decryption).

Slower but more secure, widely used in secure communications.

Used in digital signatures, SSL/TLS, and email encryption.

Examples:

RSA – Most common, used in digital signatures and SSL/TLS

ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) – More efficient than RSA

Diffie-Hellman – Used for secure key exchange



C. Hashing (One-Way Encryption)

Converts data into a fixed-length hash value.

Irreversible; mainly used for integrity verification.

Examples:

MD5 – Outdated due to vulnerabilities

SHA-1 – Weak, replaced by SHA-2 and SHA-3

SHA-256 – Secure, widely used in blockchain and security applications

Bcrypt – Used for password hashing



4. Encryption in CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)

Common Attacks on Encryption:

Brute Force Attack: Trying all possible keys.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack: Intercepting encrypted communication.

Replay Attack: Reusing captured encrypted data to trick a system.

Side-Channel Attacks: Exploiting physical characteristics (power usage, timing).

Cryptanalysis Attacks: Mathematical analysis to break encryption (e.g., differential cryptanalysis).


Tools Used in CEH for Encryption Testing:

John the Ripper – Cracks hashed passwords

Hashcat – Advanced password cracking

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) – Encrypting/decrypting files

OpenSSL – Encrypting data, generating certificates

Wireshark – Analyzing encrypted network traffic



5. Encryption in CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)

CIA Triad & Encryption:

Confidentiality: Protects sensitive data.

Integrity: Ensures data is not altered (via hashing).

Availability: Ensures encrypted data can be decrypted by authorized users.


Encryption Implementation in Security Policies:

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): Data remains encrypted throughout transmission (e.g., WhatsApp).

Transport Encryption: Protects data in transit (TLS, VPNs, IPsec).

Data-at-Rest Encryption: Protects stored data (BitLocker, VeraCrypt).

Key Management: Proper key storage and rotation to prevent compromise.

Regulatory Compliance:

GDPR, HIPAA – Requires encryption for sensitive data

FIPS 140-2 – U.S. encryption standard




6. Encryption in Real-World Security Applications

SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security): Encrypts web traffic (HTTPS).

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): Used for secure email encryption.

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): Encrypts VPN traffic.

BitLocker / FileVault: Encrypts disk storage.


7. Best Practices for Secure Encryption

✅ Use strong algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048, ECC).
✅ Implement proper key management (rotate and store securely).
✅ Enforce multi-layered encryption (data-at-rest and data-in-transit).
✅ Regularly audit and update encryption methods.
✅ Ensure compliance with legal and industry security standards.

Summary

Encryption is crucial for securing data in transit and at rest. Understanding how different encryption methods work (symmetric, asymmetric, hashing) is key for both offensive (CEH) and defensive (CISSP) security strategies. Following best practices ensures that encrypted data remains protected against cyber threats.
