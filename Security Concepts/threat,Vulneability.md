# Threat

A threat is anything that has the potential to cause harm to a system or organization. It can be a person, a situation, or a physical event.

- **Example:** Imagine you own a house. A threat could be a burglar who might break into your house.
- **Example:** A hacker who wants to steal sensitive data.

## Types of Threats
Threats can be:
- **Intentional**: Deliberate actions aimed at causing harm.
- **Unintentional**: Accidental incidents that can also lead to harm.

## Components of a Threat
To understand a threat, consider the following components:

1. **Motive**: The reason or incentive behind why a threat actor would want to carry out an attack.
2. **Opportunity**: The circumstances that allow a threat actor to carry out an attack.
3. **Means**: The resources, skills, and tools that a threat actor has at their disposal to carry out an attack.

By analyzing Motive, Opportunity, and Means, a company can better prepare for and mitigate threats.





# Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in a system that can be exploited by a threat. It is a flaw that makes an asset susceptible to damage.

## Example
- Continuing with the house analogy, a vulnerability could be an unlocked door or an open window that a burglar can easily access.
- An outdated software application with known security flaws is another example of a vulnerability.
