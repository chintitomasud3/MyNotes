# Threat

A threat is anything that has the potential to cause harm to a system or organization. It can be a person, a situation, or a physical event.

- **Example:** Imagine you own a house. A threat could be a burglar who might break into your house.
- **Example:** A hacker who wants to steal sensitive data.

## Types of Threats
Threats can be:
- **Intentional**: Deliberate actions aimed at causing harm.
- **Unintentional**: Accidental incidents that can also lead to harm.

## Components of a Threat
To understand a threat, consider the following components:

1. **Motive**: The reason or incentive behind why a threat actor would want to carry out an attack.
2. **Opportunity**: The circumstances that allow a threat actor to carry out an attack.
3. **Means**: The resources, skills, and tools that a threat actor has at their disposal to carry out an attack.

By analyzing Motive, Opportunity, and Means, a company can better prepare for and mitigate threats.





# Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in a system that can be exploited by a threat. It is a flaw that makes an asset susceptible to damage.

## Example
- Continuing with the house analogy, a vulnerability could be an unlocked door or an open window that a burglar can easily access.
- An outdated software application with known security flaws is another example of a vulnerability.


# Risk

Risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. It is the likelihood of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability and the impact it would have.

## Example
- In the house scenario, the risk is the possibility of the burglar entering through the unlocked door and stealing valuables. The risk can be quantified by considering the likelihood of a burglary occurring and the value of the items that could be stolen.
- The possibility of a hacker exploiting the software flaw to access and steal sensitive data, potentially leading to financial loss and reputational damage for the organization, is another example of risk.

## Putting It All Together
- **Threat**: A burglar.
- **Vulnerability**: An unlocked door.
- **Risk**: The chance of the burglar entering through the unlocked door and stealing valuables.

# Cybersecurity Context Example

Let’s translate this into a cybersecurity context:

- **Threat**: A hacker who wants to steal sensitive data.
- **Vulnerability**: An outdated software application with known security flaws.
- **Risk**: The possibility of the hacker exploiting the software flaw to access and steal sensitive data, potentially leading to financial loss and reputational damage for the organization.

# Risk Formula

Let's apply this formula in a simple example:

- **Likelihood** refers to the probability that a given threat will exploit a vulnerability. It is an estimation of how likely it is for a threat event to occur.
  - A measure that estimates the **occurrence** of an event.

- **Impact** refers to the potential consequences or damage resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability. It measures the severity of the adverse effects on the organization.
  - A measure that estimates the **consequence** of an event.

- **Risk** is a combination of both likelihood and impact. It quantifies the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

**Risk**: \( \text{Risk} = \text{Likelihood} \times 100 \, \text{(Impact)} = 30,000 \)
