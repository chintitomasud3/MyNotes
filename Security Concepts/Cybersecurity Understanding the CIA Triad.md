# Cybersecurity: Understanding the CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a foundational concept in cybersecurity, representing three primary principles essential for securing information and systems. These principles are:

### 1. Confidentiality

**Definition:** Confidentiality refers to the protection of information from unauthorized access and disclosure. It ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to those who have the proper authorization. Techniques to maintain confidentiality include:

**Key Practices to Ensure Confidentiality:**


- **[[Encryption]]**: Transforming data into a coded format that can only be read by someone with the decryption key.
- **Access Controls**: Implementing user authentication and authorization measures to restrict access to sensitive information.
- **Access Controls:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege, and strong authentication mechanisms like MFA.
- **Data Masking:** Obscure sensitive information when displayed in non-secure environments.
- **Secure Transmission:** Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP) to prevent interception.

**Threats to Confidentiality:**

- Unauthorized access (hacking, insider threats)
- Data breaches
- Eavesdropping or sniffing attacks
- Threat related to confidentiality are: 
1. **Snooping** involves gathering information that is left out in the open. Clean desk policies protect against snooping.
2. **Dumpster diving** also looking for sensitive materials, but in the dumpster, a paper shredding protects against it.
3. **Eavesdropping** occurs when someone secretly listen to a conversation, and it can be prevent with rules about sensitive conversations 
4. **Wiretapping** is the electronic version of eavesdropping, the best way against that is using encryption to protect the communication.
5. **Social Engineering**, the best defense is educate users to protect them against social engineering

**Example Interview Question:**

- _How would you secure confidential data in transit and at rest?_
    - **Answer:** Use end-to-end encryption for data in transit (e.g., TLS) and strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest.
    **Common Questions**:

- What are some methods to ensure data confidentiality?
- How would you handle a data breach?

**Banking Example:**

- Banks ensure confidentiality by encrypting customer account details and transaction information to prevent unauthorized access, both during online banking sessions and while stored in databases.

### 2. Integrity

**Definition:** Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle. It ensures that information is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals. Key practices to uphold integrity include:
**Key Practices to Ensure Integrity:**


- **Hashing**: Using algorithms to create a unique digital fingerprint of data, which can be used to verify its authenticity.
- **Version Control**: Keeping track of changes to documents and data to ensure that the most current and accurate version is being used.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintaining logs of who accessed or modified data, which can help identify unauthorized changes.
- **Checksums and Parity Checks:** Validate data during transmission or storage.
- **Digital Signatures:** Authenticate the source and integrity of data.

**Threats to Integrity:**

- Data tampering (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized changes)
- Malware (e.g., ransomware corrupting files)
- Insider threats
1. **Unauthorized modification** attacks make changes without permission. The best way to protect against that is the least privilege principle. 
2. **Impersonation attacks** pretend to be someone else. User education protects against impersonation attack. 
3. **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)** attacks place the attacker in the middle of a communication session, monitoring everything that's occurring. 
4. **Replay attacks** eavesdrop on logins and reuse the captured credentials. To both MiTM and Replay attacks the best approach is encryption

**Example Interview Question:**

- _How can you detect and prevent data integrity issues?_
    - **Answer:** Use cryptographic hashes for verification, implement file integrity monitoring systems, and maintain an audit log for change tracking.

**Banking Example:**

- In banking, transaction logs are protected with digital signatures and hashing to ensure that amounts, recipient details, and timestamps remain unaltered, maintaining trust in the system.

### 3. Availability

**Definition:** Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. It involves implementing measures to prevent downtime and ensure continuous access to systems and data. Strategies to enhance availability include:

**Key Practices to Ensure Availability:**


- **Redundancy**: Creating backup systems and data copies to ensure access in case of failure.
    
- **Disaster Recovery Plans**: Developing procedures to restore systems and data after a cyber incident or natural disaster.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Performing routine checks and updates to systems to prevent outages.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Perform updates, patches, and hardware checks.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including offsite backups.
- **DDoS Protection:** Implement network monitoring and mitigation techniques like rate limiting and WAFs.

**Threats to Availability:**

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Hardware or software failures
- Natural disasters or power outages
1. **Denial of Service** can be mitigated using firewalls to block unauthorized connections 
2. **Power outages** can be mitigated using redundant power and generators 
3. **Hardware failures** can be mitigated using redundant components 
4. **Destruction** can be mitigated using backups 5. Service outages

**Example Interview Question:**

- _What measures can you take to ensure system availability during a DDoS attack?_
    - **Answer:** Deploy DDoS mitigation solutions, implement rate limiting, and ensure adequate bandwidth and redundancy in infrastructure.

**Banking Example:**

- Banks prioritize availability by using redundant servers, robust DDoS protection, and disaster recovery systems to ensure customers can always access online banking and ATMs, even during peak times or cyberattacks.

### Beyond CIA: Authenticity and Nonrepudiation

Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:

#### 1. Authenticity

**Definition:** Ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source and not fraudulent or counterfeit.

**Key Practices to Ensure Authenticity:**

- **Digital Certificates:** Verify the origin of data or communication.
- **Message Authentication Codes (MACs):** Ensure the authenticity of a message.
- **User Authentication:** Use robust methods to confirm the identity of users.

**Example:** In online shopping, businesses verify the authenticity of an order to ensure it comes from a legitimate customer and not a malicious actor.

#### 2. Nonrepudiation

**Definition:** Ensuring that the original source cannot deny being the source of a particular document/file/data.

**Key Practices to Ensure Nonrepudiation:**

- **Digital Signatures:** Provide proof of origin and prevent denial of actions or communications.
- **Transaction Logs:** Record activities for accountability.

**Example:** In a business transaction involving 1000 cars, the seller needs to confirm that the buyer indeed placed the order and ensure the buyer cannot deny having placed it.

#### Relationship Between Authenticity and Nonrepudiation

These two requirements are closely related. The need to distinguish authentic files or orders from fake ones is critical. Moreover, ensuring that the source cannot deny being responsible is vital for trust in systems like banking, shopping, and patient diagnosis.

**Real-Life Scenario:**

- In online shopping, depending on your business model, you might tolerate delivering a T-shirt with cash-on-delivery only to discover later that the order was fake. However, no company can tolerate shipping 1000 cars and discovering that the order was counterfeit.
- **Authenticity:** Confirm the customer placed the order.
- **Nonrepudiation:** Ensure the customer cannot deny placing the order.

These principles ensure business operations remain trustworthy and secure.
