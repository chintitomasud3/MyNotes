A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital messages or documents


Properties of Digital Signatures:
Authenticity: Confirms the identity of the signer.
Integrity: Ensures the data has not been tampered with since signing.
Non-Repudiation: Prevents the signer from denying they signed the data, as only their private key could have created the signature.



A digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. It is like a digital ID card issued by a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA).
