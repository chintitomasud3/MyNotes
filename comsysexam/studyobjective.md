Study Tips
Practice Questions: Focus on scenario-based questions to understand application of concepts.
Labs: Simulate attacks (e.g., Kali Linux) and defenses (e.g., pfSense, Windows Defender).
Mnemonics: CIA, AAA, NIST 800-53 for frameworks.
Time Management: Exam is 90 minutes, 90 questions maxâ€”aim for 1 minute per question.
